# Web Based Inventory Management System

This project is about an inventory management system for the internal affairs of a confectionary. Inventory is an idle material resources of an enterprise awaiting future sales, use, or transformation. Inventory is the stock of any item or resource used in an organization and can include: raw materials, finished products, component parts, supplies and work-in-progress. This system provides information to efficiently manage the flow of materials, effectively utilize people and equipment, coordinate internal activities and communicate with customers.

## About The System

Some of existing system are semi-automated and many are manual to keep the transaction record as well as the internal materials of the inventory in the confectionary company. People still prefer to follow the manual method even if there is automated system to keep the record. We have found that employees first of all record all information in there ledger before entering in computer system. They are using both ways to keep the record of stock purchase, inventory, sales monitoring, costs, etc. Following this method is very time consuming and tedious. It has many drawbacks as there may be mistakes while recording large data and this may disrupt the important transaction.

So, in this project we are trying to make inventory management system which will help employees to keep record of inventories in systematic way and help them produce report about the inventory or stock currently available in their store in automatic way to help then sale forecasting, decision making about the stock etc.
